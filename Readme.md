## Giik-FM Podcast Site

[Giik.FM](http://giik.fm) is a Turkish Podcast I'm co-hosting with a fellow MVP [Yiğit Özaksüt](https://github.com/ozaksuty). 

* docs : This is the landing page for the web site hosted with Github Pages
* functions : This is a function app we used back in the days where we were hosting our own Wordpress based podcasting site. MP3 files were in Azure Storage, and we had something to track download counts and expose it on Wordpress. This is currently not in use.
